This repository began life as a fork the `Galois project <https://github.com/IntelligentSoftwareSystems/Galois>`_.
As part of the commercialization process, this repository was combined with proprietary parts of the Katana system and later disentangled.
Disentangling the open-source and proprietary components required rewriting the git history of this repository.
Because of this, commits from 2020-06-30 until 2020-10-29 (marked with ``[REWRITTEN COMMIT: incomplete subtree]``) are unbuildable and inconsistent; they are included to provide context only.
Commits from 2020-10-29 until 2020-01-01 are consistent (marked with ``[REWRITTEN COMMIT: self-contained subtree]``), but may have removed changes mentioned in the commit messages.
