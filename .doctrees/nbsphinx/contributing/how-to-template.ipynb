Provide the Katana Graph server address by setting the environment variable `KATANA_SERVER_ADDRESS`. This variable applies only to your current shell session. If you want the variable to be automatically set for future shell sessions, set the variable in your shell startup file. For more detailed information refer to the Getting Started section of the documentation. Alternatively, you can pass in the address of the remote service by calling `Client(address=\"localhost:8080\")` for Linux machines or `Client(address=\"host.docker.internal:8080\")` for macOS and Windows machines."
