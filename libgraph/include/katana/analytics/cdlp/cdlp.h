  /// Initially, all nodes are in their own community IDs (same as their
  /// node IDs). Then, the community IDs are iteratively set to the most
  /// frequent community ID in their immediate neighborhood. It continues
  /// untill the community ID of all nodes in graph become the same as
  /// the most frequent ID in their immediate neighborhood.

  /// Synchronous community detection algorithm. This algorithm is based on
  /// Graphalytics benchmark that has two key differences from the original algorithm
  /// proposed in [1]. First, it is deterministic: if there are multiple
  /// labels with their frequency equalling the maximum, it selects the smallest
  /// one while the original algorithm selects randomly. Second, it is synchronous,
  /// i.e., each iteration is computed based on the labels obtained as a result of
  /// the previous iteration.
  ///
  /// As remarked in [1], this can cause the oscillation of labels in bipartite or
  /// nearly bipartite subgraphs. This is especially true in cases where communities
  /// take the form of a star graph. This limits the maximum number of iteration.

  /// TODO (Yasin): implementing the asynchronous algorithm.
  /// Unlike Synchronous algorithm, Asynchronous can use the current iteration
  /// updated community IDs for some of the neighbors that have been already
  /// updated in the current iteration and use the old values for the other neighbors

  /// Notes and challenges:
  /// I. The order in which all the n nodes in the network are updated
  /// at each iteration is chosen randomly vs in order.
  /// if there are multiple labels with their frequency equalling the maximum, it
  /// selects one randomly.
  ///
  /// II. The output is not deterministic. it is not propoer for end to end test.
  ///
  /// III. [1] aggregates multiple solutions to get most useful information.
  ///
  /// IV. When the algorithm terminates it is possible that two or more disconnected
  /// groups of nodes have the same label (the groups are connected in the network via
  /// other nodes of different labels). This happens when two or more neighborsof a
  /// node receive its label and pass the labels in different directions, which ultimately
  /// leads to different communities adopting the same label. In such cases, after the
  /// algorithm terminates one can run a simple breadth-first search on the sub-networks
  /// of each individual groups to separate the disconnected communities. This requires
  /// an overall time of O(m + n). When aggregating solutions however, we rarely find
  /// disconnected groups within communities [1].

  /// V. The stop Criterion is: If every node has a label that the maximum number of
  /// their neighbors have, then stop the algorithm
