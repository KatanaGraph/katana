    # Approach: Generate a variant file with the versions we need in it and explicitly reference the versions from the
    # meta.yaml file. This will make adding dependencies less clean that I would like, but see failed approaches.

    # Failed approaches:
    # 1. Use an append or clobber file to override parts of meta.yaml. This either does not override enough (the former
    #    doesn't allow making version requirement stricter), or overrides too much (replaces whole lists, so jinja
    #    expression would need to be rerun, but cannot be.)
    # 2. Patch meta.yaml itself. This does not work easily because pyyaml outputs yaml in a format that conda doesn't
    #    support. Conda does some regex parsing on the yaml, so it doesn't support yaml in full generality, and requires
    #    white space in cases where pyyaml doesn't put it.
    # 3. Call the conda build pipeline directly using Python. This does not work because conda does not provide a hook
    #    (that I could find) where I need it: between yaml loading and dependency resolution. I think this is partly
    #    because the two phases are weirdly intertwined with several cases where jinja is reexecuted based on
    #    information from a solve done using a previous parse.
    # Basically, this is a total mess, and I spent way too much time on it. I hate everything.
